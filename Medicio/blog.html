                <p>Ever wondered how the lifesaving procedure we call “CPR” came to be? Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) may seem like it’s been around for ages, but the technique wasn’t finalised until 1960. Even today, medical experts implement changes to improve CPR’s effectiveness; the most recent change occurred in 2015. CPR techniques throughout

                <h3>Importance Of Emergency Kits And How To Use Them</h3>
                <p>When a medical emergency occurs, trained bystanders sometimes hesitate to act. Why? Because they’re in denial, or they’re afraid of doing something wrong. In today’s post, we’ll examine some of the reasons people don’t take action, and why imperfect care is better than no help at all. In an emergency </p>

                <h3>How To Help Someone Who Has Fainted </h3>
                <p>Fainting is a brief loss of consciousness. Someone who faints may pass out for several seconds or up to an hour. It is important that you get to the bottom of the reason. Naturally, the person should consult a physician but in an emergency, these are the steps to follow. Keep records so that you can hand them to medical professions when the time arises. Being self-reliant means keeping tabs on everyone!
